Lesson 3: If Statements
=======================

 In the previous lesson, we learned how to get input from the user. However, most of the time a program will need to
perform different actions based on user input rather than doing the same thing every time. In this lesson, we will
learn how to change the flow of our program by using if statements.
 Start by adding a new project called "PswdProtHello" to your solution. Then copy the code from the previous lesson
into the new source code file. Next we will replace the contents of the "Main" function with this code:

//Get username
Console.Write("Name: ");
string name = Console.ReadLine();

//Get password
Console.Write("Password: ");
string pswd = Console.ReadLine();

//Verify credentials
if(name == "Dylan" && pswd == "cheetah")
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello " + name + "!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("You aren't allowed here " + name + "!");
}

 We will start by getting the name and password of the current user. Next, we will need to verify the given user
credentials. To do this, we will simply compare the given name with a given string and compare the given password
with a given string. The "==" operator is used to compare 2 variables. If they are equal, the expression will
evaluate true. If they are not equal, the expression will evaluate false. The "&&" operator indicates that the 
expressions on both sides must be true in order for the entire expression to evaluate true. If the expression inside
the parenthesis for the if statement evaluates true, the code inside the body of the if statement will be executed.
If the expression evaluates false, the code inside the body of the else statement will be executed instead. Please
note that the else statement is optional. In this program, we will only say hello to the user if their credentials were 
successfully validated. Otherwise, we will tell them they aren't allowed here.
 In the next lesson, we will explore how to define and use additional functions in our code.
